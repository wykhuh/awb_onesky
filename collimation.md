# Collimation

if you have a laser collimator, use the 3 adjustment screws to put the laser dot in the center. then adjust the knobs in the back to align the primary. If no laser you can align with the Cheshire

the provided collimator is very easy to use. Worse comes to worse and its just not working out by yourself, you can have a friend turn the knobs why you watch the effect. I wouldnt stress out about it!

pretty easy, lots of guides on here, 1st might take 10-15 mins after that maybe 5 mins. im fairly new too and I did it when I got the tool to do it.

Yes it comes with a collimation cap.,good luck.,,enjoy.,give us a first light report here please.,

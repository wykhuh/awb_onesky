# Mounts

I had done something similar from tripod legs of Astromaster scope. I found pre cut 19" boards at Home Depot. The board is bolted to the base  3/8" bolt. I still prefer mounting on a my Versa Go II. Included wooden table top mount unfortunately could not handle high magnification. I had switch to Versa Go II which is a match made in heaven for this OTA.

I use milk crates for my Starblast 4.5 and I think they work great! I use one for the scope and another for a seat.

Otherwise I'd say the difference to me for a camera tripod and an Astronomy alt-az tripod is the idea of a slow movement gear to allow smoother tracking both up and down as well as left and right, without having to first loosen the clamp and then move / retighten.  It helps to be able to constantly move the head with the least effort, but I refuse to pay $100+ dollars for an "astronomy" head when an astronomy "mount with included tripod" might be close enough.  The real issue is how much weight your tripod and mount head are carrying and are rated to carry at all angles, especially pointed at zenith (which seems hardest for my setup).  Pointing flat or midway into the sky has never been an issue for me.  I have a cheap alt-az skywatcher mount

The tube assembly sans the base weighs 7 lb, 10 oz. This puts it right to the limit of that Dwarf Star mount. Knowing Universal Astronomics, I'm going to guess that their numbers are conservative, and the mount can probably handle the weight just fine.

Steve is correct that the OneSky OTA is just under 8 lbs.  My ES ED80 triplet is at 7.5 lbs.  The rating for the UA Dwarf Star is conservative as Steve suggests.  Even with the ES 82 24mm (24.8 oz) in the focuser, there ares no issues with the package.  The link showing the OneSky on the Dwarf Star is not mine, but I know that he doesn't have any issues with the set up.

I've added the light shroud and built a little table for more comfortable viewing.

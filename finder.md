 If you get tired of fighting with the RDF, I can highly recommend using a green laser finder. The laser allows you just to look up instead of crawling or crouching down to get behind the RDF. Even in my light pollution infested driveway, it still works great. I noticed that I can easily align it exactly just by looking at the beam in an eyepiece and adjusting it so the beam points to dead center of FOV. I just get it close when I put it on my scope and fine tune it in the FOV. The beam is not intrusive nor does it interfere with eyesight in the eyepiece either.

 The laser finders look nice, however I live within 5 miles of LGB airport.  I'm also a pilot myself and am very sensitive to laser pointers.  They can be dangerous when someone lights you from the ground.  We're not under the direct landing/takeoff path under most weather conditions, but it would still make me uncomfortable.

 I had problems in the cold with the first (5mW) green laser I bought, it wouldn't work at all. I've since upgraded to a 100mW laser, that thing works all day every day no matter what the temperature is. Only problem is it's too big for the laser mount...

 Most cheap lasers do not work well in the cold. Plan on paying at least $100 or more for a good laser rated for cold weather use. Even those need to be tested after purchase to see if they meet their stated spec's.


# RDF

 As others have said, we've seen this before. We replaced some RDF's and then realized it's not a problem with the RDF itself but just how it's mounted. The mount lets you clamp it in in a way that doesn't give enough alignment adjustment. Just loosen it up and tighten it again, maybe holding it in the center when you tighten it.

I have to remove and re-attach the RDF every time I pack and unpack! I have gotten very good at it, and now, I actually like the RDF. Just make sure to install it looking at a light pole for alignment! I have to slide mine back a little to get it right. Also, unscrew the screws all the way, and make sure you have each screw turned the same number of times so it is even!

# Telerad

 ,A telrad would not serve you any better then the finder that comes with it.,Myself and others have put a laser pointer on the scope.,much more user friendly.,much less twisting/contorting to point your scope,.good luck.,,hope you get your first light soon.,

 A telrad is huge. I think the green laser finder was the second best mod after the light shroud. Easy to use...no contorting your body. Plus, with the finder shoe being standard, it fits every other scope I use.

 There is no doubt that a Telred is an excellent tool to find things in the sky, but I say again, it is not the tool for the OneSky. This is because it has to be mounted on the lower tube. Unless you've mounted your OneSky on a very tall mount, you are going to be laying on the ground contorting your head to aim the scope. YMMV.

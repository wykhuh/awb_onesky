# Goto

I have been shopping for a SynScan controller upgrade for my Virtuoso mount and was shocked at the price ($300+), So I bought a cheap, discontinued Orion 102mm Mak goto scope that had the new version SynScan controller. I am telling myself I got a goto mount and a 102mm Mak for $40 bucks over the cost of the hand controller, lol.

I had a chance tonight to really put the Onesky/Virtuoso mount through a good tracking test. I connected the Synscan controller to the Virtuoso and did a precise alignment. I did not use weighted magnets for balance as it doesn't need that now. Goto was spot on in all parts of the sky.

Cool, my wife bought a virtuoso and she isn't a big fan of the 90mm Mak that came with it.  We'll likely be plugging the OneSky onto that and I'll tripod mount the 90mm Mak or put it on the OneSky mount.  I'm getting the supplies together to run the virtuoso from my computer and make it full GoTo through Stellarium like the gentleman from Brazil did.

I am using the Orion STARSEEKER IV for my Vixen BT-81 Binocular and One sky. The reason to have Starseeker IV because, it can be use as DSC.

 I put my OneSky on a Virtuoso mount and use it off a small table (16x16x16). It works great. Some people put it on a plastic tote container and others have made elaborate stands that adjust in height out of boat seat pedestals. I observe while seated 100 percent of the time so something about 16" tall seems to put the EP right in my comfort zone no matter where it's pointed. I hooked my Synscan hand controller up to it too. Now it's a full goto system. There was some concern about the scope being too big for that mount but I've got almost a year behind me with medium use and have had zero problems so far. It tracks as well as my SE mount and puts objects near center if properly aligned. Sometimes I put it back on it's supplied mount to practice finding things but it's so much better as a goto system. If you have any questions, let me know and I'll try to help.

Here's a little video I put together which shows what I did:   https://youtu.be/EAc0m7uuHk4

Trying something new. I put the OneSky on my Celestron SLT mount today and it works great. With the legs fully retracted, it's super stabile and just the right height for viewing from a seated position. That mount is a little prone to vibration with the legs even half way out so this might be a good way to get the best out of that mount too.

 I read somewhere that the mount still needs to be aligned (two star or brightest star) with the Synscan hand controller before Stellarium can be used to drive the mount. I have been looking for Synscan controllers. They are very expensive! Until I resolve this, I am using my OneSky on the Virtuoso mount and brushing up on my star hopping and trying to get better at finding things the old fashioned way.


Yeah, we're still using all our GoTo equipment manually right now just because we still enjoy the challenge of finding the objects on our own.  But yes, you still have to do a star alignment, but there is software out there that is supposed to deal with deleting the hand controller and just run it through the computer.  I've seen where they have done it on youtube and such, I just need to get the items in I need to get it done.  I mean it's literally like $15 worth of parts and some program downloads.  I have an email chain with him and he's helping me, but I haven't got the parts yet.

I use this OTA on Nexstar GT Mount which routinely goes on sale for $80 or less here in classifieds. I put that on a home made tripod legs made from 2X3s. That mount not only handles this 7 lb OTA well but it is also a "go-to" mount that comes with Nexstar + Hand Controller. Whereas Virtuoso only does tracking but no go-to.

Additionally my concern is that for motorized mounts you need sturdy tripod. Anything you put on milk crates or bar stools or picnic tables is not going to be sufficient for consistent tracking.

Boom! Made for each other. No issue with clearance where I balanced it and locked it down (after I took this pic). A very minor issue with balance using heaviest eyepiece. I can't go down any further on the dovetail due to clearance between mount base and mirror locking screws but a bar magnet weight resting along the extreme back of the dovetail will solve that pronto.

It's light enough to pick up the whole thing with one hand. This mount tracks really well (been using a little 90mm Mak on it). I programmed my latitude the first time and align it to Polaris and switch it on. That's all there is to it. It tracks well no matter where I point it even with the Mak's "drinking straw like" FOV. It has dual encoders so you can loosen the clutches and move it by hand, re-tighten them, and it stays aligned and tracks like a champ! Has a jack for my power tank and a jack for a Synscan hand controller for full go-to capability (that's on my buy list). I have been using it with eight rechargeable AA batteries in their compartment. I have not had to recharge them after about ten hours of use so far - the mount doesn't chew up batteries fast like the Celestron does.

I devoted tonight to my experiment with mating the OneSky to the Skywatcher Virtuoso mount. I'm happy to report it was a complete success. The "little scope that could" has found a new home on the "little mount that could".  In fact I would say this is a perfect match for drop dead simplicity with the convenience of tracking. Earlier today, I collimated the primary which was super easy. This evening, I set it up on a 16"x16"x16" table in just a couple minutes and went to work. I was able to use the scope while comfortably seated all evening. No tripod legs to trip on or bump into!

 My last Newtonian was a Celestron 130SLT and vibration was so bad it took over five seconds on average to settle after touching the focuser and forget about using it if there was any hint of breeze whatsoever. The Onesky settles out in a second or two, max, on this mount...much better! I attribute this to the way the dovetail plate is fastened to the entire length of the OneSky's tube...a far superior method over a short length of dovetail pop riveted to the middle of a highly flexible tube like my old Newt. The Virtuoso mount is built like a mini tank with nice rubber feet so that helps too.

I wanted to see how it tracked with the OneSky so I centered Polaris in a 10mm eyepiece, turned on the mount and swung over to Orion, centered it, then started my timer. After six minutes Orion was still in the center third of the eyepiece. I was happy with that result but noticed I didn't have the mount perfectly level so it could be better if I get that right next time.  I tried it again with my slightly unlevel mount...this time on Jupiter. I put in an 8mm and timed it. It drifted about 2/3rds of the way to the edge after five minutes. Again, not bad for the mount not being level. Once again, this baby delivered beautiful results. Everything in the eyepiece is just gorgeous.

 Bottom line. The AWB OneSky and this little mount are a solid match. Now that I am convinced they work well together, I feel comfortable putting some money into the Synscan hand controller for full goto capability.


I took some pictures to show clearances and measured everything. When the mount's dovetail lock is centered on the OneSky's dovetail bar, there is exactly 1/4" clearance between the mount base and one of the primary's locking screws at it's closest point of approach (25 degrees on the mount's latitude circle). When pointed at the zenith, there is exactly 1/2" inch clearance between the mount and the locking screws. I put in my heaviest eyepiece (Meade 8-24mm zoom @ .54lbs/245grams) and ran the mount through all it's ranges, up, down, left and right. There are no issues with the motors struggling either connected to my Celestron power tank or the mount's AA battery pack. I used this all evening last night and had zero problems. The scope falls within the mount's payload capacity. Even with the right angle finderscope and a heavy eyepiece, all went perfectly well.

It's a tad front heavy where I have it locked down (at midpoint of OneSky's dovetail bar). I noticed when I loosened the altitude clutch with my 1/2 pound eyepiece in place, it wanted to go nose down. Without my finder and using the supplied eyepieces, it's pretty well balanced at midpoint on the dovetail bar. I would suggest some guidance in the instructions on where to lock it down and on balancing if you offer these two as a package.

you might want to consider putting another hole in the OneSky dovetail for a screw - use that as a mark to rest on the dovetail mount on the Virtuoso. I've marked the dovetail on all of my OTAs, it's nice not having to balance them afterwards

Based on your testing I'm going to go back to SkyWatcher and see if we can do some testing ourselves here. The tech person there who is also very much a hands-on amateur doing a lot of things thought there was no way this would work. That's what I thought just looking at it. So much for theory. :) Especially if it can track OK still being slightly unbalanced.

When the Virtuoso came out we thought it might be something we could sell for fundraising (perhaps with a discount from SW) as an upgrade for the OneSky for those who wanted tracking mounts. It looks like it's time to revisit that idea based on your testing.

The first word from SkyWatcher this morning -- which I post here for anyone considering this upgrade path -- is that they're still concerned about the balance being off even if just a little. While it will handle the load fine the balance issue could cause extra stress on the plastic gears, which might be a long-term issue. They also suggested that this might not be the best recommendation for beginners who might not get the OneSky OTA positioned just right, or recognize the need to handle the setup properly when it's out of balance (like knowing it will nose dive with a heavy eyepiece in it).

Interesting conversation.  I am waiting to receive my OneSky the end of this month or early April.  I was thinking about getting a Celestron CG-4 to get it up off the ground & for tracking, but now not so sure.  I also read that the Virtuoso can mount to a sturdy tripod.  I already have a Celestron Heavy Duty Alt-Az.  Maybe I should go the Virtuoso route for about $70 less to boot. Don't know. One reasons I went with the OneSky is portability.  I would like to hear from you experienced OneSkies your thoughts on the OneSky and a Celestron CG-4 or a Virtuoso/Virtuoso+Celestron HD Alt-Az.

I was worried about getting it up higher but with the Virtuoso mount sitting on a 16-18" tall table or a Rubbermaid storage bin (which it fits in) of a similar height, it is a great height for use while sitting in a chair. My lawnchair and wheelchair have about an 18-20" seat height. I'm 5'9", and I don't have to stretch, bend down, or do calisthenics to get to the eyepiece at all. All night use while seated in comfort is a good thing. Plus the drink holder comes in handy, lol. I like that I don't have tripod legs to watch out for too.

Regarding portability, I'm guessing the mount and OneSky together weigh about 16-18 pounds and fit in an 18 gallon Rubbermaid storage bin.

Of course, if you are into astrophotography, this mount will require you to take lots of very short exposures that need stacking or a video system. I haven't tried that yet.
